# Sample Site 01
This is a simple, generic website that I created to showcase my skills in web development. It is a responsive website that is mobile friendly and has a clean and modern design. The goal is to create a website that utilizes Bootstrap, JavaScript, and custom styles to create a visually appealing and functional website.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at [https://richnsd.github.io/sample-site-01/](https://richnsd.github.io/sample-site-01/).

Because the site is hosted using GitHub pages, it is a static website and does not have any server-side functionality (namely PHP). The contact form is a placeholder and does not actually send any emails.
